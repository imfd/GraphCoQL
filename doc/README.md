# Documentation

This folder contains the `coqdoc` generated documentation. Once the project is built, `coqdoc` generates html files containing a prettified version of the code, which can then be explored on a browser.

The documentation has been improved by including [CoqdocJS](https://github.com/tebbi/coqdocjs) and [Bootstrap v.4.0](https://getbootstrap.com).

To explore the documentation, you should start by opening the file `html/toc.html`, containing the table of contents.

The contents of this folder is summarized as follows:
1. `./html` : Contains the generated documentation, in html files.
1. `./assets` : Contains the CoqdocJS assets to prettify and improve navigation in the generated documentation. It also contains the header importing Bootstrap.
1. `./imgs` : Contains images used in the documentation of some files (mostly images for the examples).

Finally, another option is to visit the (WIP) [project's documentation page](graphcoql.netlify.com).
